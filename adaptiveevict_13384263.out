Thus, it is not possible to determine the number of mobile users to get the optimal number of the nodes of each job. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that is based on the concept of maximum-likelihood estimation. The algorithm first identifies the number of nodes in the job and provides the best solution. The algorithm then uses the similarity of nodes in the job to select the optimal subset of nodes. Then, the node is selected to select the subset of nodes that are in the job.

This construction allows us to generalize the results of the construction of a simple family of operators of a number of non-negative integers.
