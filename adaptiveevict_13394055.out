The second is the vitamin D status of the subjects. In the second group, the vitamin D level was not significantly different between the groups.

The MWIR-HeMOR signal is a very powerful, low-power optical communications system, which has the advantage of providing a more compact and efficient optical interconnection network. This technique has the advantages of high
