Then by edge detection, feature extraction method is selected and then the texture is processed, and classified. Firstly the image is processed. Then, feature of image is extracted. Then the image is preprocessed by feature selection, and then a new feature selection algorithm is proposed to improve the classification accuracy. The result shows that the accuracy of image classification is improved by using classification rate. The experimental results show that the model trained model can improve the recognition accuracy of image classification.
