The first objective of this thesis is to show that it is possible to use the 2D mesh to solve the 3D problem, while maintaining a constant speed of convergence.


Design/methodology/approach
This paper describes the application of a method for solving the 2D mesh in a three-dimensional mesh. The method is based on the use of an integral equation solver to obtain the solution of the problem. The numerical simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the computational time, improve the accuracy of the numerical simulation.

The microcracks of these microcracks are not necessarily connected to the machining. The microcracks are often caused by cracks and cracks.
