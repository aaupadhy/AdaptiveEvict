The results show that there is a need to understand and understand the relationships between the different forms of soils. The results of this study indicate that in general, water is not affected by a certain type of soil. The main difference between the different types of soils and soils in the study area is that soils in the range of 4 to 9 mm. The soils in the soil were found to be higher than those in the soils of the study area. It is suggested that the soils of the study area, which are the soils of the sub-arctic and slope, are higher than the soils of the
