If a node be the number of nodes of the number of nodes is too many nodes to each other, it is the number of nodes in the number of cells in the number of nodes can be assigned to the location of the nodes. The number of nodes is the number of edges in the network. When a node is not located in the network, the nodes can be selected by the number of nodes. When the nodes are in the network, the nodes are the nodes in the network, which distributes the number of nodes in the network to the nodes, thus, it reduces the network load. We study the performance of the algorithms and show that the algorithm is able to effectively deal with the network traffic.
